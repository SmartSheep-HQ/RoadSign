### How fast is it?

We use roadsign and nginx to host a same static file, and test them with [go-wrk](https://github.com/tsliwowicz/go-wrk). 
Here's the result:

|      **Software**     | Total Requests | Requests per Seconds | Transfer per Seconds |   Avg Time  | Fastest Time | Slowest Time | Errors Count |
|:---------------------:|:--------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|:-----------:|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|
|        _Nginx_        |     515749     |        4299.58       |        2.05MB        | 13.954846ms |      0s (Cached)      |  410.6972ms  |       0      |
|       _RoadSign_      |     8905230    |       76626.70       | 30.98MB       |  783.016Âµs  |      28.542Âµs      |   46.773083ms  |       0      |
| _RoadSign w/ Prefork_ |     4784308    |       40170.41       |        16.24MB        | 1.493636ms |      34.291Âµs      |  8.727666ms  |       0      |

As result, roadsign undoubtedly is the fastest one.

It can be found that the prefork feature makes RoadSign more stable in concurrency. We can see this from the **Slowest Time**. At the same time, the **Fastest Time** is affected because reusing ports requires some extra steps to handle load balancing. Enable this feature at your own discretion depending on your use case.
